# Deep Learning Enabled Single View Motion Capture
 
In the video games and film industries, the standard approach to animation is costly, inconvenient and requires a lot of space. While this is not a pressing issue, solving it could improve the workflow of larger studios and more importantly empower indie developers and hobbyists to easier and quicker realise their vision. Through the use of deep learning and single-camera footage, motion capture could be made more accessible and convenient to work with and if done well could providing immense improvements to motion capture and animation and potentially replace established industry technologies such as optical motion.
